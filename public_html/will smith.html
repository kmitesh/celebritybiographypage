Smith started as the MC of the hip-hop duo DJ Jazzy Jeff & The Fresh Prince, 
with his childhood friend Jeffrey "DJ Jazzy Jeff" Townes as turntablist and 
producer, as well as Ready Rock C (Clarence Holmes) as the human beat box.
The trio was known for performing humorous, radio-friendly songs, most notably 
"Parents Just Don't Understand" and "Summertime".[16] They gained critical 
acclaim and won the first Grammy awarded in the Rap category (1988). 

Smith's first major roles were in the drama Six Degrees of Separation (1993) 
and the action film Bad Boys (1995) in which he starred opposite of Martin Lawrence.

In 1996, Smith starred as part of an ensemble cast in Roland Emmerich's Independence Day.
The film was a massive blockbuster, becoming the second highest grossing film in
history at the time and establishing Smith as a prime box office draw. He 
later struck gold again in the summer of 1997 alongside Tommy Lee Jones in the
summer hit Men in Black playing Agent J. In 1998, Smith starred with Gene Hackman 
in Enemy of the State.
