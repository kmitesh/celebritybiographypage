Cristiano Ronaldo dos Santos Aveiro, OIH (born 5 February 1985), known as
Cristiano Ronaldo, is a Portuguese footballer who plays as a forward for Spanish
club Real Madrid and captains the Portugal national team. He became the most
expensive footballer in history when he moved from Manchester United to Real 
Madrid in 2009 in a transfer worth £80 million (€94 million/$132 million). 
Ronaldo's contract with Real Madrid, under the terms of which he is paid €21
million per year (after taxes), makes him the highest-paid footballer in the 
world, and his buyout clause is valued at €1 billion as per his contract.

At the age of eight, Ronaldo played for amateur team Andorinha, where his father 
was the kit man. In 1995, Ronaldo signed with local club Nacional, and, after a 
title-winning campaign, he went on a three-day trial with Sporting CP, who 
subsequently signed him for an undisclosed sum.
