At the age of 14, Adams worked as a dish washer to save money for a proper 
guitar. He started auditioning as a guitarist while rehearsing his own band in
his mother's rented basement in North Vancouver. Adams elected to sing until
they found a singer, but they never found one, and his auditioning landed him
a few jobs, with bands like Shock and Sweeney Todd, who in 1976 released If
Wishes Were Horses with the 15-year-old Adams as the singer.[11] He quit school 
to play nightclubs and go on the road and upon his return he settled into the 
Vancouver studio scene, working as a background vocalist for the CBC and working
with keyboardist Robbie King, whom Adams attributes as having given him his 
first paying session.

In 1978, at the age of 18, Adams met Jim Vallance introduced by a mutual friend 
in a Vancouver music store. Vallance was the former drummer and principal 
songwriter for Vancouver based rock band Prism and had recently quit that band 
to focus on a career as a studio musician and songwriter.
