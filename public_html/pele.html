Edson Arantes do Nascimento (Brazilian Portuguese: better known as Pelé 
(Brazilian Portuguese: name given as Edison on birth certificate,
born 21 October 1940 – however, Pelé claims that he was born on 23 October),
is a retired Brazilian footballer. He is regarded by many experts, football 
critics, former players, current players and football fans in general as the 
best player of all time. In 1999, he was voted World Player of the Century
by the International Federation of Football History & Statistics.[13] The same
year, influential France Football magazine consulted their former Ballon D'Or 
winners to elect the Football Player of the Century. Pelé came in first place.
In 1999, Pelé was elected "Athlete of the Century" by the IOC, and was named in 
Time magazine's list of 100 most influential people of the 20th century. In
2013 he received the FIFA Ballon d'Or Prix d'Honneur in recognition of his 
career and achievements as a global icon of football.

In 1956, de Brito took Pelé to Santos, an industrial and port city in the state
of São Paulo, to try out for professional club Santos FC telling the directors 
at Santos that the 15-year-old would be "the greatest football player in the
world." Pelé was able to impress Santos coach Lula during his trial at
the Estádio Vila Belmiro. He subsequently signed a professional contract with
the club in June 1956. Pelé was highly promoted in the local media as
a future superstar. He made his senior team debut on 7 September 1956 at the 
age of 16 against Corinthians Santo Andre and had an impressive performance 
in a 7–1 victory. Pelé scored the first of his record 1281 goals in football
during the match.
