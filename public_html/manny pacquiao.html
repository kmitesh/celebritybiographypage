<p>
In 1995, the death of a young aspiring boxer and close friend, Eugene Barutag,
spurred the young Pacquiao to pursue a professional boxing career. Pacquiao 
started his professional boxing career when he was just 16 years old, stood at 
4'11'' and weighed 98 pounds under the minimumweight division). He 
admitted before American media that he put weights in his pockets to make the 
105-pound weight limit. His early light flyweight division fights took place
in small local venues and were shown on Vintage Sports' Blow by Blow, an evening 
boxing show. His professional debut was a four-round bout against Edmund "Enting"
Ignacio, on January 22, 1995, which Pacquiao won via decision, becoming an instant
star of the program.

Pacquiao's weight increased from 106 to 113 pounds before losing in his 12th bout
against Rustico Torrecampo via a third-round knockout. Pacquiao failed to make 
the required weight, so he was forced to use heavier gloves than Torrecampo, 
thereby putting him at a disadvantage.
