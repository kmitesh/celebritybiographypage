<p>
Schwarzenegger wanted to move from bodybuilding into acting, finally achieving
it when he was chosen to play the role of Hercules in 1970's Hercules in New York.
Credited under the name "Arnold Strong," his accent in the film was so thick that
his lines were dubbed after production. His second film appearance was as a 
deaf mute hit-man for the mob in director Robert Altman's The Long Goodbye (1973),
which was followed by a much more significant part in the film Stay Hungry (1976),
for which he was awarded a Golden Globe for New Male Star of the Year. Schwarzenegger
has discussed his early struggles in developing his acting career. "It was very 
difficult for me in the beginning – I was told by agents and casting people that
my body was 'too weird', that I had a funny accent, and that my name was too long.
You name it, and they told me I had to change it. Basically, everywhere I turned,
I was told that I had no chance."
