Victoria Caroline Beckham (née Adams; born 17 April 1974)is an English businesswoman,
fashion designer, model and singer. In the late 1990s, Beckham rose to fame 
with the all-female pop group Spice Girls and was dubbed Posh Spice by the July 
1996 issue of the British pop music magazine Top of the Pops. Since the Spice
Girls split, she has had a solo pop music career, scoring four UK Top 10 singles.
Her first single to be released, "Out of Your Mind", reached Number 2 in the UK
Singles Chart and is her highest chart entry to date. During her solo career, 
she has been signed to Virgin Records and Telstar Records.
