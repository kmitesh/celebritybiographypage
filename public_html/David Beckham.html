  David Robert Joseph Beckham (born 2 May 1975)is an English
  former footballer. He has played for Manchester United, Preston North End, Real
  Madrid, Milan, Los Angeles Galaxy, Paris Saint-Germain, and the England national
  team for which he holds the appearance record for an outfield player. He was 
  the first English player to win league titles in four countries (which were England,
  Spain, the United States and France). He announced his intention to retire at the end 
  of the 2012–13 Ligue 1 season on 16 May 2013 and, on 18 May 2013, played his final
  game of his storied 20-year career.

Beckham was part of a group of young players at the club who guided the club to
win the FA Youth Cup in May 1992, with Beckham scoring in the second leg of 
the final against Crystal Palace. He made his first appearance for United's first-team 
that year, as a substitute in a League Cup match against Brighton & Hove Albion,
and signed his first professional contract shortly afterwards. United reached the
final of the Youth Cup again the following year, with Beckham playing in their 
defeat by Leeds United, and he won another medal in 1994 when the club's reserve 
team won their league, although he did not play in any first team games that season.

As the summer 2003 transfer window approached, Manchester United appeared keen 
to sell Beckham to Barcelona and the two clubs even announced that they
reached a deal for Beckham's transfer, but instead he joined reigning Spanish 
champions Real Madrid for €35 million
