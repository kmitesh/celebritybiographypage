Boyle was raised in Blackburn, West Lothian, Scotland. to Irish parents 
originally from County Donegal, Ireland. Her father, Patrick Boyle, 
was a miner and veteran of the Second World War who also worked as a singer
at the Bishop's Blaize; her mother Bridget was a shorthand typist, Boyle
was the youngest of four brothers and five sisters. She was raised thinking 
that she had been briefly deprived of oxygen during a difficult birth resulting
in a learning disability. She has, however, recently been told she was misdiagnosed
and instead has Aspergers Syndrome with an IQ "above average". Boyle says she was
bullied as a child, and was nicknamed "Susie Simple" at school.
