Lewis Carl Davidson Hamilton, MBE (born 7 January 1985) is a British Formula
One racing driver from England, currently racing for the Mercedes AMG team. He
is the 2008 Formula One World Champion.

Hamilton was born in Stevenage, Hertfordshire. In December 1995, at the age
of ten, he approached McLaren team principal Ron Dennis at the Autosport Awards
ceremony and told him, "I want to race for you one day ... I want to race for 
McLaren." Less than three years later McLaren and Mercedes-Benz signed him to 
their Young Driver Support Programme.

Hamilton was born on 7 January 1985 in Stevenage, Hertfordshire, England, 
and was named after American sprinter Carl Lewis. Hamilton's mother, Carmen 
Larbalestier, is white British, while his father, Anthony Hamilton, is black 
British, making him mixed-race, (Anthony Hamilton's parents emigrated from
Grenada to the United Kingdom in the 1950s).

Hamilton began karting in 1993 at the age of eight, at the Rye House Kart 
Circuit and quickly began winning races and Cadet class championships. At 
the age of ten he approached McLaren F1 team boss Ron Dennis for an autograph,
and told him, "Hi. I'm Lewis Hamilton. I won the British Championship and one 
day I want to be racing your cars".
