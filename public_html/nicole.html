Nicole Scherzinger born Nicole 
Prescovia Elikolani Valiente; June 29, 1978) is an American recording artist, 
actress and television personality. Following her departure from Eden's Crush,
she auditioned for the burlesque inspired recording group, The Pussycat Dolls 
and she subsequently signed a contract with Interscope Records. The group's 
debut album, PCD (2005) and its follow-up Doll Domination (2008) both set 
records for girl groups. It was a breakthrough in her career that brought 
her to widespread prominence. Many of the group's songs became worldwide hits 
including "Don't Cha", "Stickwitu", "Buttons", When I Grow Up", "I Hate This 
Part" and "Jai Ho! (You Are My Destiny)". However, despite their commercial 
success, the group was plagued by internal conflict which led to the downfall 
and disbandment of the group.

Scherzinger was born Nicole Prescovia Elikolani Valiente in Honolulu, Hawaii,
into a staunchly Roman Catholic family. Her father, Alfonso Valiente,
is of Filipino descent, and her mother, Rosemary Elikolani, is of Hawaiian
and Russian[13] descent. Her mother was eighteen at the time of Scherzinger's 
birth and lived in an inner city neighborhood.[15] Scherzinger's parents separated
when she was still a baby. When she was six years old, her maternal family moved to
Louisville, Kentucky, with her sister, Keala, and her German American stepfather,
Gary Scherzinger.

By the start of the millennium, Scherzinger left Days of the New in hopes to 
become a solo artist. In 2001, Scherzinger went on to audition on The WB's
television show, Popstars in which she auditioned with Whitney Houston's version
of "I Will Always Love You"
