<p>
Arthur was born in Middlesbrough, to parents from the United Kingdom ― an 
English mother, Shirley Ashworth, and a Scottish father, Neil Arthur. Neil
is a delivery driver, but also used to be a DJ and drummer for many years,
whilst Shirley was a fashion model and later a sales and marketing professional.
Neil and Shirley split up when James was one year old and each settled with new 
partners a few years after their divorce. They hardly spoke with one another for
more than 20 years, but they agreed to attend James's audition together in a
family reunion to support him.
