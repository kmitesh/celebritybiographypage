Bloom's first appearance on the screen was in a small role, as a rent boy, in the 1997 film Wilde. 
Two days after graduating from Guildhall in 1999, he was cast in his first major role, playing
 Legolas in The Lord of the Rings film trilogy (2001–2003). He had originally auditioned for 
 the part of Faramir, who does not appear until the second movie, but the director, Peter Jackson, 
 cast him as Legolas instead. While shooting a scene, he broke a rib after falling off a horse, 
 but eventually recovered and continued shooting. At the same time, Bloom also played a brief
 role in the war film Black Hawk Down as PFC. Todd Blackburn. In 2002, he was chosen as one of 
 the Teen People "25 Hottest Stars Under 25" and was named People's hottest Hollywood bachelor 
 in the magazine's 2004 list. All members of the cast of the Rings films were nominated for
 Best Ensemble Acting at the Screen Actors Guild Awards for three years in a row, finally winning
 in 2003 for the third film, The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King. Bloom has also won other awards,
 including European Film Awards, Hollywood Festival Award, Empire Awards and Teen Choice Awards, and
 has been nominated for many others. Most of Bloom's box office successes have been as part of an ensemble cast.
