In 1976, Jackie Chan received a telegram from Willie Chan, a film producer in 
the Hong Kong film industry who had been impressed with Jackie's stunt work. 
Willie Chan offered him an acting role in a film directed by Lo Wei. Lo had seen 
Chan's performance in the John Woo film Hand of Death (1976) and planned to model
him after Bruce Lee with the film New Fist of Fury.

Willie Chan became Jackie's personal manager and firm friend, and has remained 
so for over 30 years. He was instrumental in launching Chan's international career, 
beginning with his first forays into the American film industry in the 1980s. 
His first Hollywood film was Battle Creek Brawl in 1980. Chan then played a
minor role in the 1981 film The Cannonball Run, which grossed $100 million worldwide.
