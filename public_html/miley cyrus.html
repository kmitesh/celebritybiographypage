Miley Ray Cyrus (born Destiny Hope Cyrus; November 23, 1992) is an American 
actress and singer. She is a daughter of country singer Billy Ray Cyrus, and 
held minor roles in the television series Doc and the film Big Fish in her
childhood. In 2006, Cyrus rose to prominence as a teen idol after being cast 
in the Disney Channel television series Hannah Montana, in which she portrayed
the starring character Miley Stewart. After signing a recording contract with 
Hollywood Records in 2007, Cyrus released her debut studio album Meet Miley Cyrus.
It was certified quadruple-platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America 
(RIAA) for exceeding four million shipments, and produced the hit single "See You Again".

Destiny Hope Cyrus was born on November 23, 1992, in Nashville, Tennessee, 
to Letitia Jean "Tish" Finley and country singer Billy Ray Cyrus. Her name 
was derived from her parents' belief that she would accomplish great things, 
and she was given the nickname "Smiley", later shortened to "Miley", because 
she often smiled as an infant. She officially changed her name to Miley Ray 
Cyrus in 2008; her middle name honors her paternal grandfather, Democratic 
politician Ronald Ray Cyrus, to whom she remained close until his death in 
2006. Against the advice of her father's record company, Cyrus's parents
secretly married a month after her birth on December 28, 1992. They had two
more children together, son Braison and daughter Noah. Cyrus has two elder 
maternal half-siblings, Trace and Brandi, and an elder paternal half-brother 
named Christopher. Christopher grew up with his mother Kristin Luckey in South 
Carolina. Three of her siblings also eventually entered the entertainment 
business; Trace as a vocalist and guitarist for the electronic pop band Metro 
Station, Noah as an actress, and Brandi as a guitarist. Cyrus's 
godmother is entertainer Dolly Parton.
