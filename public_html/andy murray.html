Leon Smith, Murray's tennis coach from 11 to 17, described Murray as 
"unbelievably competitive", while Murray attributes his abilities to the 
motivation gained from losing to his older brother Jamie. At the age of 12,
Murray won his age group at the Orange Bowl, a prestigious event for junior players.

In July 2003, Murray started out on the Challenger and Futures circuit. 
In his first tournament, he reached the quarterfinals of the Manchester challenger.
In September, Murray won his first senior title by taking the Glasgow Futures event.
He also reached the semi-finals of the Edinburgh Futures event. In July 2004 
Murray played a Challenger event in Nottingham, where he lost to future Grand 
Slam finalist Jo-Wilfried Tsonga in the second round. Murray then went on to win
events in Xàtiva and Rome.
