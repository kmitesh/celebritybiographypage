<p>
As she grew up with a family who all worked behind the camera, Stewart thought 
she would become a screenwriter/director, but never considered being an actor. 
"I never wanted to be the center of attention – I wasn't that 'I want to be famous, 
I want to be an actor' kid. I never sought out acting, but I always practiced my 
autograph because I love pens. I'd write my name on everything."[12] Stewart's 
acting career began at the age of eight, after an agent saw her perform in her 
elementary school's Christmas play.

On November 16, 2007, Summit Entertainment announced that Stewart would play main 
character Isabella "Bella" Swan in the film Twilight, based on Stephenie Meyer's 
bestselling vampire romance novel of the same name. Stewart was on the set of
Adventureland when director Catherine Hardwicke visited her for an informal screen 
test which "captivated" the director. She starred alongside Robert Pattinson,
who plays Edward Cullen, her character's vampire boyfriend. The film began production
in February 2008 and finished filming in May 2008.
