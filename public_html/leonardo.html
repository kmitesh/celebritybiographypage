DiCaprio's career began with his appearance in several commercials and educational
films. After being removed from the set of children's television series Romper 
Room for being disruptive at the age of five, he followed his older 
stepbrother Adam Farrar into television commercials, landing an ad for Matchbox 
cars at 14. In 1990, he got his break on television when he was cast in the 
short-lived series based on the movie Parenthood. After Parenthood, DiCaprio had 
bit parts on several shows, including The New Lassie and Roseanne, as well as a
brief stint on the soap opera Santa Barbara, playing the young Mason Capwell.

the Young Artist Award for Best Young Actor each.
